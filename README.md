# cs229-Final-Project
Text-Based Prediction of MBTI Personality Types

Milestone To-Do's: 

1. Explore the data (kinda done)
2. Preprocess the data: (done)
    - probably lemmatize and make everything lowercase, tokenize (tf-idf)
    - split the data into training and test sets (the data is in the data folder)

3. Test out a model: Multinomial Naive Bayes (use sklearn)
4. Test out another model: Logistic Regression or some other model
